## How to Install (Will only apply once there are releases)

Under the releases tab from this page, download the file corresponding to your operating system.

On Windows or Mac, follow the instructions in the installer to install the plugin to your plugins folder.

On Linux, you'll have to copy DelayLines.vst3 to your plugin folder. Often this is at ~/.vst3.

If you have any issues, please raise an issue on the issues page of this repository and describe your situation.
