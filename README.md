# Delay Lines (work in progress)

Delay lines can be many things: echoes, reverbs, filters, spaces, resonances.
This plugin envisions delay lines as, well, actual lines in a web that can be dragged and stretched like a spiders web,
to let you build these spaces before your very eyes.
As a delay line drags longer, it gets lower in pitch, and vice versa, so dragging the web can send its delays spiraling. 

Note that this plugin is still in early development: commits are not guaranteed to work. Keep an eye out for a
mildly stable release one of these days.
